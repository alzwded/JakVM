Todo list
=========

* Spec
    - specify alternative data memory (another block of 64k accessed serially)
* Assembler
    - core
    - assembling multiple files
    - macros
* Emulator
    - CPU (almost done, the remaining stuff depends on the UI and finishing the spec)
    - UI
        + common (setting up the CPU emu, implementing the main loop)
        + gfx (screen, rendering sprites and backgrounds)
        + sfx (sound, 2 squares, 1 triangle, PCM)
        + input (joystick/keyboard, debug hotkeys)
* Compiler
    - TBD
