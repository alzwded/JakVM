grammar-generator           generates the run-time emulator's skeleton and
                            the assembler's skeleton
assembler                   some checking, binding and pasting
                            uses files generated by the grammar-generator
emulator                    contains the processor's definition and runtime
                            does not include stuff that's tied to ports
                            uses files generated by the grammar-generator
keyboard                    keyboard input, glued to some ports on the emulator
screen                      screen output, glued to some ports on the emulator
printer                     text output, useful for debugging, I imagine
